1 Data table creation:
	1 Eagle board file - reading design rules and creating net classes.
		1 Net class created diff.
	1 Creating physical constraint set 0105000_millimeters
		1 Net class created ground.
	1 Creating physical constraint set 0000000_millimeters
		1 Net class created single.
	1 Creating physical constraint set 0145000_millimeters
	1 Creating Layer mapping table
	1 Creating text sizes
	Data table creation took (seconds): 0

	2 Setting smdPin->line/shape and thrPin->line/shape spacing: 0.150000
	2 Setting Via->line/shape spacing: 0.150000
	2 Setting smdPin->smdPin and thrpin->thrpin spacing: 0.150000
	2 Setting Via->smdPin/thrPin spacing: 0.150000
	2 Setting Via->via spacing: 0.150000
	2 Setting same net Via->shape and shape->smdPin/thrPin spacing: 0.254000

Warnings
	Duplicate footprint names found!
		Fix issue transferring footprint names from PCB Editor to OrCAD Capture.
		Update property file created "AD9910_Finished_3rd_backanno.upd" in C:/Users/alexi/Downloads/Eagle Environment/projects/AD9910/
		In OrCAD Capture do the following
		1. Go to Project Manager
		2. Select "Tools -> Update Properties"
		3. Select "Unconditionally update the property" checkbox.
		4. Browse and select the update property file mentioned above
		5. Click "OK" to update the schematic design in OrCAD Capture with correct footprint names

		After the above steps are performed a netlist can be created in OrCAD Capture and imported to PCB Editor.
