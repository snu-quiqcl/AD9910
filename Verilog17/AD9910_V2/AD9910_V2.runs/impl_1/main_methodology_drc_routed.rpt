2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.175 ns between device_DNA_inst/DNA_PORT_read_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and device_DNA_inst/DNA_PORT_inst/READ (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.175 ns between device_DNA_inst/DNA_PORT_shift_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and device_DNA_inst/DNA_PORT_inst/SHIFT (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
