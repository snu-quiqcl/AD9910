LVSERIAL LICENCE
----------------

LVSERIAL is a library of functions and VIs to support serial port (RS232) 
communication. It is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
specified below. Documentation is included in each VI (use Ctrl+H and move 
the mouse over VI, controls and indicators).

The basic library functions are written in C. The library uses major 
parts of the PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) library.

To Windfreak Technologies from Martin Henz Systemtechnik (the author of lvserial):

Hi David,

originally I wanted to see the lvserial library "open source" and as free as possible from any restrictions. Thats one of the reasons why I didn't integrate it into the OpenG library, because the OpenG library is not really complete open source and they also used the GNU general public licence for a long time. Ok, in the meantime OpenG has partly or completely changed to the BSD licence.

Anyway, the lvserial library also uses the PCRE library
(http://www.pcre.org/) witch is under the BSD licence .

For people/companies who wants to see a licence for lvserial I add the less restrictive BSD licence: The 2-Clause BSD License https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause

For the lvserial itself: Make with it, whatever you want. On request, I'll send you the C-source code of the actual version. The actual version is nearly identical to the version you actually have.
Distribute it with or without the lvserial BSD licence.


Because  lvserial  uses the PCRE library you have to distribute a copy of  the PCRE licence (see attachment PCRE_LIBRARY.txt). You can either
- make a hard copy in the documentation of your software or
- copy it into the installation folder (subfolder) or
- copy the PCRE_LICENCE on the distribution media (usb-stick, CD, zip-file)

That's all.

Because some other people wants to see a licence for lvserial, I also added the LVSERIAL_LICENCE.txt file to this E-Mail. Use it or not...
If you want to add it to your software, then copy it in the same way as the PCRE_LIBRARY.txt file.
