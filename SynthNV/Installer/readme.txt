SynthNV 3.0a GUI Readme notes:
Version 3.0a is the first SynthNV GUI software that removes dependency on National Instruments VISA

Version 3.0a main changes are:
1)	Removes dependency on NI VISA and any conflicts with other VISA packages from Keysight, Tek, R&S etc.
2)	Added wheel mouse zones for frequency and amplitude control.
3)	Added the ability to easily run multiple instances of the GUI to control multiple devices at once
4)	The newer 2017 Labview Runtime does not support any Windows OS older than Windows 7 SP1.  XP and Vista are no longer supported.

Thanks to Martin Henz Systemtechnik for the use of lvserial to drive the COM port instead of NI VISA.

If possible, its best to uninstall all Windfreak and National Instruments software using "Add Remove Programs" before installing the new version.

If you install this software and run into any bugs I would love to hear about them.

Sincerely,
